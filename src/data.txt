exting does not require the caller and recipient to
both be free at the same moment; this permits communication
even between busy individuals. Text messages can also be used to interact
with automated systems, for example, to order products
or services from e-commerce websites, or to participate
in online contests. Advertisers and service providers use
direct text marketing to send messages to mobile users about
promotions, payment due dates, and other notifications
instead of using postal mail, email, or voicemail.
